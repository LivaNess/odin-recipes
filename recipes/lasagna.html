        <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta. It is often served on overlapping sheets interspersed with layers of ingredients to taste, 
            most often meat in bolognese sauce and bechamel sauce.</p>
        
        <p>Its origin is Italian and the dish that is usually prepared with
        meat is called baked lasagna.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400 grams of ground beef (lean and low fat)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of oil</li>
            <li>1/2 white onion finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups finely chopped green bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of Knorr® Juicy Rib</li>
            <li>12 sheets of pasta for precooked lasagna</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>150 grams of grated mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>10 fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil and fry the chopped onion with the garlic and pepper.
               Once they change color (from white to transparent) add the meat and cook until browned.</li>
            <li>Season with Knorr® Juicy Rib, pepper and cinnamon. Reserve.</li>
            <li>In a previously greased baking pan, place a sauce base and a layer of ground meat. 
              Cover with a layer of lasagna sheets.</li>
            <li>Add more sauce, more meat and cover again with pasta. Repeat these steps until the mold is filled.</li>
            <li>Finish with a layer of tomato sauce. Spread the mozzarella cheese over the lasagna and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake at 180°C for 35 to 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Five minutes before you take the lasagna out of the oven, remove the foil to allow the cheese to brown evenly.</li>
            <li>Serve and decorate with fresh basil leaves.</li>
        </ol>
