        <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p> Pizza is a culinary preparation that consists of a flat bread, usually circular in shape, made with wheat flour, yeast, 
            water and salt (sometimes olive oil) that is traditionally covered with tomato sauce and mozzarella and baked at high temperature
            in a wood oven.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>250g Flour Premix for Pizza</li>
            <li>250g Natural Yogurt Without Added Sugar</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce to taste</li>
            <li>fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>dried oregano to taste</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220ÂºC. Place the flour premix for pizza in a large container and add Natural Yogurt Without Added Sugar.</li>
            <li>Mix well until the ingredients are incorporated, adding a little more flour if it is very sticky. 
                Knead for a couple of minutes until you have a homogeneous, smooth and lump-free dough, slightly sticky but that
                 comes off your fingers when you touch it. Lightly brush a pan with olive oil and then stretch the dough on the 
                 surface. (It is recommended to leave the dough very thin)</li>
            <li>Cover with natural tomato sauce without reaching the edges, distribute the mozzarella cut into small pieces. Add oregano, a splash 
                of oil and bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the dough is golden and the cheese is well melted.</li>
        </ol>
